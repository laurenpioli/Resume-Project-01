            <h3>December 1, 2020:  Div Soup Fix</h3>
                <p>Today, I worked on making sure my HTML didn't fall into the 'div soup' problem. Div Soup
                    is when programmers use the div element so much in their code, it makes it difficult
                    for folks using screen readers to navigate their web page. Divs can be very helpful in
                    wrapping content while designing web pages. But when used too much, it can make it
                    difficult for those using screen readers to understand the content and flow of a web
                    page and potentially stop using it altogether.</br>
                    Using HTML elements that describe a section of content more precisely makes the verbal
                    description more clear to those who can't see the content. It's important for programmers
                    to keep this in mind while designing web pages becuase it helps make the web accessible
                    and usable to everyone, no matter how they are accessing it.</p>
                <p>I don't have too much code yet, so it wasn't difficult to make this fix today.</br>
                    I noticed two locations where I had divs that could be changed to more specific HTML
                    elements. The first instance I fixed was the div I had surrounding my header. This div was
                    where I was applying my header style. Using a div here is unnecessary becuase I could
                    apply that style directly to my header element.</p>
                <p>The second was a div I was using as the structure to my main page content. As you may have
                    guessed, this div can be replaced by the main HTML element to make it more clear.</p>
                <p>An added benefit to fixing div soup in your code is that it makes your code a bit easier
                    to interpret for anyone reading or collaborating on your web page.</br>
                    Once you make changes to your code like this, you always want to make sure your CSS
                    styles aren't affected. Luckily, I style my pages with classes most of the time so I
                    didn't have to change my CSS code.</p>
