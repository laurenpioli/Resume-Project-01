# Resume-Project-01

This is a project for me to show off my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It is a coding blog that I will add to as I learn more coding languages and build 
upon the languages I already know. The Home page discusses the project overall. 
There is a navigation with links to each language's own page.

I used visual studio code to write my code. I used git bash to import my files into 
GitHub.

To view, please clone the repository to your workstation and view the index.html in your 
web browser.

The Code Louisville requirements that I believe I have satisfied are:
1. The project is built mobile first. </br>
In my responsive.css file, it should begin to show in one column.
Then, once a screen flips to landscape, some items show side-by-side.
Once the screen gets a bit larger, it adjusts once again to have the navigation links
display in a row. </br>
Then there are a few more adjustments once the screen gets to a likely desktop size.

Look in:  responsive.css. Begin at line 1 with Main Page Formatting.

2. The project has at least 2 media queries. </br>
I have 3 media queries.

Look in:  responsive.css. Begin at line 68 with Media Queries.

3. Project is uploaded to GitHub with at least 5 separate commits. </br>
I have at this time 37 commits to GitHub.

4. Project includes a README. </br>
This is my README.

5. CSS Feature #1 </br>
My project has the first feature:  a navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes. </br>
It switches from vertical to horizontal.

Look in:  responsive.css. Begin at line 92 with the .flex-item class.
Referenced in:  index.html. Begin at line 23 with the navigation list items.

6. CSS Feature #2 </br>
My project uses flexbox to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views.

Look in:  responsive.css. Begin at line 49 with Flexbox to see where my flex containers are defined.

7. JavaScript Feature #1 </br>
My project has two JavaScript functions that perform some form of mathematical operation and displays the result on the page. </br>
On the JavaScript page, there are two mathematical functions that run using guest input.
The first one will generate a random number. Click in the first input field and then enter a number in
numerical format. If you fail to enter a number or any input, an error will display on the screen.
If you enter a number in numerical format, a random number will be generated between 1 and your number
and display on the screen in HTML. </br>
The second one will calculate how many weeks you've been alive. First, click in the second input field on the screen.
Enter your age in years in numerical format. Then, it asks you to enter in a time period to convert your age into. This is in the form of a dropdown menu. </br>
It only works on 'weeks' so far. It will calculate how many weeks you've been alive
and enter that number on the page in HTML. It will also display formatting errors.

Look in:  javascript.js. Begin at line 1 for the Random Number Generator.
Referenced in:  javascript-page.html. Begin at line 39 with the description of the first mathematical function.

Look in:  javascript.js. Begin at line 39 for the Age Recalculator.
Referenced in:  javascript-page.html. Begin at line 56 with the description of the second mathematical function.
